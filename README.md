# Music-Mood-Analysis
The Music Mood Analysis project uses natural language processing and machine learning to classify the emotional tone of song lyrics. By processing lyrics—removing punctuation, tokenizing words, filtering stopwords, and applying stemming—the project extracts meaningful features. Techniques like Count Vectorization, TF-IDF, and n-grams convert lyrics into numerical data for analysis.

The project tests several machine learning models, including Random Forest, Decision Tree, SVM, and XGBoost, achieving strong validation accuracies upto 94%, especially with Sentence BERT and TF-IDF based models. Visual comparisons highlight the performance of each approach, showcasing the effectiveness of these methods in capturing the mood of lyrical content.

This work has practical applications, such as creating personalized playlists, analyzing music for therapy, and predicting listener preferences. It bridges data science and the arts, demonstrating how computational tools can interpret the emotional essence of music. Future work could incorporate audio features or user feedback to enhance the analysis further.
